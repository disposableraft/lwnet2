<p>Yesterday, I deployed the second major version of lancewakeling.net. Four years ago, when I left NYC, I let my all my domains lapse, and I basically took a longggg break from coding, and from projects in general. Last May, however, I bought a laptop and began coding in fits and starts. Most of the projects I started and — after a flurry of commits — abandoned.</p>

<p>Gatsby is fun to work with because it&rsquo;s almost instantly gratifying. Although I agree with a friend who said that if you weren&rsquo;t already familiar with Node, React, Graphql and so on, then Gatsby would be an overwhelming learn. Luckily, there&rsquo;s a ton of documentation, and I&rsquo;ve used all three technologies on previous projects. So picking up Gatsby has been painless (save for a minor setback migrating from <code>MarkdownRemark</code> to <code>MDX</code>).</p>

<p>For this version of the site, I iterated on the design, using a newly installed library, <a href="https://chakra-ui.com/">Chakra UI</a>. The first version of the site was essentially a placeholder. Now that I&rsquo;m starting to look for work again, I&rsquo;d like to have something to show people, and it&rsquo;s fun to ship something, even if I&rsquo;m the only person who knows it&rsquo;s out there.</p>
