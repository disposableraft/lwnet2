<h1>On Disposable Furniture</h1>

<hr>

<p>Since moving to Portland, I&rsquo;ve been thinking more about the disposability of contemporary furniture. During my walks, as the rainy months set in, I see cheap particleboard shelves and tables delaminating on street corners. Their fates unsealed, so to speak.</p>

<p>The American home is glutted with cheap, disposable furniture. Furniture that is so cheaply made it can barely withstand a move to a new home without breaking. Its value fades quickly. So that after a season or three, the only option is the landfill.</p>

<p>Though mass producers have introduced modern furniture designs to a wide market, they rely on a cycle of unsustainable and destructive production. I imagine the various materials &ndash; steel, wood, glue, paint and plastic &ndash; shipped across the globe &ndash; crisscrossing each other in a complicated dance, until they&rsquo;re finally assembled together in factories far away from where the customers will eventually buy, use and discard them.</p>

<p>All this movement: frenetic, destructive, and job creating.</p>

<p>I think of all the amateur woodworkers. Across the nation, in both unincorporated areas and big cities, there are thousands of woodshops &ndash; shops fully capable of producing quality furniture. Some are more professional, dedicated solely to production, while most are amateur affairs, which share the garage with storage and a family car.</p>

<p>I keep thinking, what about another way? Something that retains what capitalsm discards and connects what it fractures. What if there were a way to employ the workshops of America to build sturdy, local, and well-designed furniture without &ldquo;disrupting a market&rdquo; with a startup or exploiting a new set of task rabbits?</p>

<p>We often leap to technological solutions, but I&rsquo;m not so sure that&rsquo;s the answer. We have everything we need locally, we just need to make use of it. What we need is a change in mindset.</p>
